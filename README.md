Let Nextcloud Assistant take off tasks from your todo list. Context Agent provides the AI chat in Assistant with the tools to perform actions in your Nextcloud upon sending instructions in a chat message, for example
- sending an email
- writing a message in a Talk room
- creating calendar entries

and much more. 

This app needs Nextcloud Assistant and an AI provider to work.
Read [the documentation](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/ai/app_context_agent.html).
